# Human Checkpoints in Plans

Plans execute autonomously. Checkpoints formalize the interaction points where human verification or decisions are needed.

**Core principle:** Claude automates everything with CLI/API. Checkpoints are for verification and decisions, not manual work.

## Checkpoint Types

### 1. `checkpoint:human-verify` (Most Common)

**When:** Claude completed automated work, human confirms it works correctly.

**Use for:**
- Visual UI checks (layout, styling, responsiveness)
- Interactive flows (click through wizard, test user flows)
- Functional verification (feature works as expected)
- Audio/video playback quality
- Animation smoothness
- Accessibility testing

**Structure:**
```xml
<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>[What Claude automated and deployed/built]</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    [Exact steps to test - URLs, commands, expected behavior]
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>[How to continue - "approved", "yes", or describe issues]</resume-signal>
</task>
```

### 2. `checkpoint:decision`

**When:** Human must make choice that affects implementation direction.

**Use for:**
- Technology selection (which auth provider, which database)
- Architecture decisions (monorepo vs separate repos)
- Design choices (color scheme, layout approach)
- Feature prioritization (which variant to build)
- Data model decisions (schema structure)

**Structure:**
```xml
<task type="checkpoint:decision" gate="blocking">
  <decision>[What's being decided]</decision>
  <context>[Why this decision matters]</context>
  <options>
    <option id="option-a">
      <name>[Option name]</name>
      <pros>[Benefits]</pros>
      <cons>[Tradeoffs]</cons>
    </option>
    <option id="option-b">
      <name>[Option name]</name>
      <pros>[Benefits]</pros>
      <cons>[Tradeoffs]</cons>
    </option>
  </options>
  <resume-signal>[How to indicate choice]</resume-signal>
</task>
```

### 3. `checkpoint:human-action` (Rare)

**When:** Action has NO CLI/API and requires human-only interaction, OR Claude hit an authentication gate during automation.

**Use ONLY for:**
- **Authentication gates** - Claude tried to use CLI/API but needs credentials to continue
- Email verification links (account creation requires clicking email)
- SMS 2FA codes (phone verification)
- Manual account approvals (platform requires human review before API access)
- Credit card 3D Secure flows (web-based payment authorization)

## Execution Protocol

When Claude encounters `type="checkpoint:*"`:

1. **Stop immediately** - do not proceed to next task
2. **Display checkpoint clearly**
3. **Wait for user response** - do not hallucinate completion
4. **Verify if possible** - check files, run tests, whatever is specified
5. **Resume execution** - continue to next task only after confirmation

## Writing Good Checkpoints

**DO:**
- Automate everything with CLI/API before checkpoint
- Be specific: "Visit https://myapp.vercel.app" not "check deployment"
- Number verification steps: easier to follow
- State expected outcomes: "You should see X"
- Provide context: why this checkpoint exists
- Make verification executable: clear, testable steps

**DON'T:**
- Ask human to do work Claude can automate (deploy, create resources, run builds)
- Assume knowledge: "Configure the usual settings"
- Skip steps: "Set up database" (too vague)
- Mix multiple verifications in one checkpoint (split them)

## Summary

**The golden rule:** If Claude CAN automate it, Claude MUST automate it.

**Checkpoint priority:**
1. **checkpoint:human-verify** (90% of checkpoints) - Claude automated everything, human confirms visual/functional correctness
2. **checkpoint:decision** (9% of checkpoints) - Human makes architectural/technology choices
3. **checkpoint:human-action** (1% of checkpoints) - Truly unavoidable manual steps with no API/CLI
